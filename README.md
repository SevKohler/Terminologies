# Terminology namespace for openEHR
This file is used to provide a holistic collection of health related terminologies. 
These are standardized as a namespace. 
They are aligned with the [OMOP Vocabulary](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0) (similar namespaces) and [HL7](https://terminology.hl7.org/external_terminologies.html)
The list is to be used to standardized terminologies in openEHR.

If you encounter a terminology that is missing, please make a PULL-REQUEST. 

Spaces and slashes are not allowed in the Namespace, - is to be used instead.
